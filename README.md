# 🏗 Architecture

This project follows a **modern serverless architecture**.

```
User Browser
     │
     ▼
React Frontend (Vite + Tailwind)
     │
     ├── Faculty Data Request
     │       │
     │       ▼
     │   Vercel Serverless API (/api/faculty)
     │       │
     │       ▼
     │   Strapi CMS (vitap.ac.in)
     │
     └── Faculty Ratings
             │
             ▼
        Firebase Firestore
```

### Why this architecture?

Instead of calling the CMS directly from the browser, the frontend communicates with a **serverless API layer**.

Benefits:

- 🔐 Secure API token handling  
- 🚀 Faster responses using edge caching  
- 🛠 Ability to transform API data  
- 🧠 CMS structure hidden from the client  

Firebase is used to handle **user-generated data (faculty ratings)** efficiently.

# ⚡ Performance Optimization

The CMS API can be slow (~4 seconds), so the serverless API implements **Vercel Edge Caching**.

```
Cache-Control: s-maxage=600, stale-while-revalidate
```

### Result

| Request Type | Response Time |
|--------------|---------------|
| First Request | ~4 seconds |
| Cached Requests | ~50–150 ms |
